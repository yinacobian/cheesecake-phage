# cheesecake-phage
Phage genomes annotation workshop August 2023

You found a new phage, congrats! Now what?

### Materials:
A phage genome in fasta format

The fasta format:

>phage-cheesecake
ATGATGATGATGATGGTCCTG

### 1. Get a phage genome

A fasta file is a plain text file that contains the sequence name and the sequence itself.

You can get phage genomes from NCBI.  

For example: The genome of phage lambda  

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_001416.1?report=fasta

### 2. Edit the name of your phage genome

Open the phage genome file in a text editor (for example Notepad++ https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/ , or notepad)

#### 2.1 Modify the first line to the name you want. Do not use special characters (like ampersand, tilde, hashtag, etc..)

>Phage_Cheesecake

#### 2.2 Save the text file as .fasta

PhageCheesecake.fasta

### 3. Phage genome annotation

Create an account at: https://www.bv-brc.org/

### 4. Phage proteomic tree

Go to the following website: https://www.genome.jp/viptree/

### 5. Make a phage genome map


### 6. There is always little details to modify in your phage genome figures. A free tool to edit these maps is Inkscape https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.3/




### 6. Prepare a GenBank file for submission
